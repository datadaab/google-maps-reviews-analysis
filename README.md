Overview

This project explores customer experience at IKEA Greenwich, recognized as one of the most sustainable IKEA stores worldwide. Opened in February 2019 and boasting an ‘outstanding’ BREEAM certification, the store exemplifies sustainable building and community-focused design. However, beyond its accolades, this analysis aims to understand how the store is perceived through the eyes of its customers.

Using a dataset of over 10,000 Google Maps reviews scraped via Outscraper.com, this exploratory data analysis focuses on assessing the current state of customer perception based on a comprehensive evaluation of publicly available customer feedback. The quantitative analysis emphasizes trends and patterns in the frequency and distribution of customer reviews over the years.
Key Areas Impacted by Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty
Customer Loyalty

High levels of customer satisfaction often translate into repeat visits and purchases, signifying strong customer loyalty. This is crucial for sustained business growth and maintaining a competitive edge.
Customer Retention

Analyzing customer feedback helps gauge retention rates, highlighting how many customers continue to visit the store after their initial experience. High retention rates indicate customer satisfaction and trust in the brand.
Word of Mouth and Brand Reputation

Positive reviews and high customer satisfaction contribute to a strong brand reputation. Satisfied customers are more likely to recommend the store to others, enhancing word-of-mouth marketing and attracting new customers.
Service and Product Improvement

Feedback analysis helps identify areas of improvement in both products and services. Addressing customer concerns leads to better service quality and product offerings, further boosting satisfaction and loyalty.
Community Engagement

As a community-focused store, understanding customer feedback helps IKEA Greenwich strengthen its community relations. Positive community engagement fosters a loyal customer base and enhances the store's role as a community hub.
